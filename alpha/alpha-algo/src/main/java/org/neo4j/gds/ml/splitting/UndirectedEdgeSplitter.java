/**
 * Splits an undirected graph into two Relationships objects.
 * The first represents a holdout set and is a directed graph.
 * The second represents the remaining graph and is also undirected.
 * For each held out undirected edge, the holdout set is populated with
 * an edge with the same underlying node pair but with random direction.
 * The holdout fraction is denominated in fraction of undirected edges.
