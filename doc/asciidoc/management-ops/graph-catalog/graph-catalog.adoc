--
This section details the graph catalog operations available to manage named graph projections within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Graph algorithms run on a graph data model which is a _projection_ of the Neo4j property graph data model.
A graph projection can be seen as a materialized view over the stored graph, containing only analytically relevant, potentially aggregated, topological and property information.
Graph projections are stored entirely in-memory using compressed data structures optimized for topology and property lookup operations.

The graph catalog is a concept within the GDS library that allows managing multiple graph projections by name.
Using its name, a graph projection can be used many times in the analytical workflow.
Named graphs can be projected using either a <<catalog-graph-project, Native projection>> or a <<catalog-graph-project-cypher, Cypher projection>>.
After usage, named graphs can be removed from the catalog to free up main memory.

[NOTE]
====
The graph catalog exists as long as the Neo4j instance is running.
When Neo4j is restarted, graphs stored in the catalog are lost.

This chapter explains the available graph catalog operations.

[NOTE]
====
Projecting, using, listing, and dropping named graphs are management operations bound to a Neo4j user.
Graphs projected by a different Neo4j user are not accessible at any time.
