= Projecting graphs using Cypher Aggregation

[abstract]
--
This section details projecting GDS graphs using `Cypher` aggregations.
--


A projected graph can be stored in the catalog under a user-defined name.
Using that name, the graph can be referred to by any algorithm in the library.
This allows multiple algorithms to use the same graph without having to project it on each algorithm run.

Using Cypher aggregations is a more flexible and expressive approach with diminished focus on performance compared to the <<catalog-graph-project, native projections>>.
Cypher projections are primarily recommended for the development phase (see <<common-usage>>).

[NOTE]
--
There is also a way to generate a random graph, see <<graph-generation, Graph Generation>> documentation for more details.
--

[NOTE]
--
The projected graph will reside in the catalog until:

- the graph is dropped using <<catalog-graph-drop, gds.graph.drop>>
- the Neo4j database from which the graph was projected is stopped or dropped
- the Neo4j database management system is stopped.

[[graph-project-cypher-aggregation-syntax]]
== Syntax

A Cypher aggregation is used in a query as an aggregation over the relationships that are being projected.
It takes three mandatory arguments: `graphName`, `sourceNode` and `targetNode`.
In addition, the optional `sourceNodeProperties`, `targetNodeProperties`, and `relationshipProperties` parameters allows us to project properties.

[[graph-project-cypher-aggregation-examples]]
== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS Cypher Aggregation we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j.
The example graph looks like this:

image::example-graphs/graph-project-example.svg[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),
  (veselin:Person { name: 'Veselin', age: 20, ratings: [5.0] }),
  (hobbit:Book { name: 'The Hobbit', isbn: 1234, numberOfPages: 310, ratings: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5] }),
  (frankenstein:Book { name: 'Frankenstein', isbn: 4242, price: 19.99 }),

[[graph-project-cypher-aggregation-example-single-label-type]]
=== Simple graph

A simple graph is a graph with only one node label and relationship type, i.e., a monopartite graph.
We are going to start with demonstrating how to load a simple graph by projecting only the `Person` node label and `KNOWS` relationship type.

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` nodes and `KNOWS` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Person)-[r:KNOWS]->(target:Person)
WITH gds.alpha.graph.project('persons', source, target) AS g
RETURN
  g.graphName AS graph, g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1m"]
|===
| graph     | nodes | rels
| "persons" | 3     | 2
|===
--

==== Graph with unconnected nodes

In order to project nodes that are not connected, we can use an `OPTIONAL MATCH`.
To demonstrate we are projecting all nodes, where some might be connected with the `KNOWS` relationship type.

[role=query-example]
--
.Project all nodes and `KNOWS` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source) OPTIONAL MATCH (source)-[r:KNOWS]->(target)
WITH gds.alpha.graph.project('persons', source, target) AS g
RETURN
  g.graphName AS graph, g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1m"]
|===
| graph     | nodes | rels
| "persons" | 5     | 2
|===
--


=== Multi-graph

A multi-graph is a graph with multiple node labels and relationship types.

To retain the label when we load multiple node labels, we can add a `sourceNodeLabels` key and a `targetNodeLabels` key to the fourth `nodesConfig` parameter.
-- To retain the type information when we load multiple relationship types, we can add a `relationshipType` key to the fifth `relationshipConfig` parameter.

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `KNOWS` and `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source)
WHERE source:Person OR source:Book
OPTIONAL MATCH (source)-[r:KNOWS|READ]->(target)
WHERE target:Person OR target:Book
WITH gds.alpha.graph.project(
  'personsAndBooks',
  source,
  target,
  {
    sourceNodeLabels: labels(source),
    targetNodeLabels: labels(target)
  },
  {
    relationshipType: type(r)
  }
) AS g
RETURN g.graphName AS graph , g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1m,1m"]
|===
| graph             | nodes  | rels
| "personsAndBooks" | 5      | 6
|===
--

The value for `sourceNodeLabels` or `targetNodeLabels` can be one of the following:

.*NodeLabels key
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1m"]
|===
| type           | example                     | description
| List of String | `labels(s)` or `['A', 'B']` | Associate all labels in that list with the source or target node
| String         | `'A'`                       | Associate that label with the source or target node
| Boolean        | `true`                      | Associate all labels of the source or target node; same as `labels(s)`
| Boolean        | `false`                     | Don't load any label information for the source or target node; same as if `nodeLabels` was missing
|===


The value for `relationshipType` must be a `String`:

.relationshipType key
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1m"]
|===
| type           | example            | description
| String         | `type(r)` or `'A'` | Associate that type with the relationship
|===


=== Relationship orientation

The native projection supports specifying an orientation per relationship type.
The Cypher Aggregation will treat every relationship returned by the relationship query as if it was in `NATURAL` orientation.
It is thus not possible to project graphs in `UNDIRECTED` or `REVERSE` orientation when Cypher projections are used.

[NOTE]
--
Some algorithms require that the graph was loaded with `UNDIRECTED` orientation.
These algorithms can not be used with a graph projected by a Cypher Aggregation.
--


[[node-properties-example]]
=== Node properties

To load node properties, we add a map of all properties for the source and target nodes.
Thereby, we use the Cypher function https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-coalesce[_coalesce()_] function to specify the default value, if the node does not have the property.

The properties for the source node are specified as `sourceNodeProperties` key in the fourth `nodesConfig` parameter.
The properties for the target node are specified as `targetNodeProperties` key in the fourth `nodesConfig` parameter.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-node-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `KNOWS` and `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source)-[r:KNOWS|READ]->(target)
WHERE source:Book OR source:Person
WITH gds.alpha.graph.project(
  'graphWithProperties',
  source,
  target,
  {
    sourceNodeProperties: source { age: coalesce(source.age, 18), price: coalesce(source.price, 5.0), .ratings },
    targetNodeProperties: target { age: coalesce(target.age, 18), price: coalesce(target.price, 5.0), .ratings }
  }
) as g
RETURN g.graphName AS graph , g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph                 | nodes  | rels
| "graphWithProperties" | 5      | 6
|===
--

The projected `graphWithProperties` graph contains five nodes and six relationships.
In a Cypher Aggregation every node will get the same properties, which means you can't have node-specific properties.
For instance in the example above the `Person` nodes will also get `ratings` and `price` properties, while `Book` nodes get the `age` property.

Further, the `price` property has a default value of `5.0`.
Not every book has a price specified in the example graph.
In the following we check if the price was correctly projected:

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-node-properties]
--
.Verify the ratings property of Adam in the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Book)
RETURN n.name AS name, gds.util.nodeProperty('graphWithProperties', id(n), 'price') AS price
ORDER BY price
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1"]
|===
| name          | price
| "The Hobbit"  | 5.0
| "Frankenstein"| 19.99
|===
--

We can see, that the price was projected with the Hobbit having the default price of 5.0.


[[cypher-aggregation-relationship-properties]]
=== Relationship properties

Analogous to node properties, we can project relationship properties using the fifth parameter.
If we only want to project relationship properties and not any node properties or labels, we must provide a `{}` value for the nodesConfig parameter.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-rel-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `READ` relationships with `numberOfPages` property:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source)-[r:READ]->(target)
WITH gds.alpha.graph.project(
  'readWithProperties',
  source,
  target,
  {},
  { properties: r { .numberOfPages } }
) AS g
RETURN
  g.graphName AS graph, g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph                | nodes  | rels
| "readWithProperties" | 5      | 4
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` was correctly loaded.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-rel-properties]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` from the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty('readWithProperties', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY person ASC, numberOfPages DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 42.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 4.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | NaN
|===
--

We can see, that the `numberOfPages` are loaded. The default property value is `Double.Nan` and can be changed as in the previous example <<node-properties-example>> by using the Cypher function https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-coalesce[_coalesce()_].


=== Parallel relationships

The Property Graph Model in Neo4j supports parallel relationships, i.e., multiple relationships between two nodes.
By default, GDS preserves the parallel relationships.
For some algorithms, we want the projected graph to contain at most one relationship between two nodes.

The simplest way to achieve relationship deduplication is to use the `DISTINCT` operator in the relationship query.
Alternatively, we can aggregate the parallel relationship by using the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/aggregating/#functions-count[_count()_] function and store the count as a relationship property.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-count-aggregate]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `COUNT` aggregated `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source)-[r:READ]->(target)
WITH source, target, count(r) AS numberOfReads
WITH gds.alpha.graph.project('readCount', source, target, {}, { properties: { numberOfReads: numberOfReads } }) AS g
RETURN
  g.graphName AS graph, g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph       | nodes  | rels
| "readCount" | 5      | 3
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the `READ` relationships were correctly aggregated.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-count-aggregate]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfReads` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty('readCount', 'numberOfReads')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfReads
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfReads
ORDER BY numberOfReads DESC, person
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfReads
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 2.0
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 1.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | 1.0
|===
--

We can see, that the two READ relationships between Florentin and the Hobbit result in `2` numberOfReads.


=== Parallel relationships with properties

For graphs with relationship properties we can also use other aggregations documented in the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/aggregating/[Cypher Manual].

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-sum-aggregate]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and aggregated `READ` relationships by summing the `numberOfPages`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source)-[r:READ]->(target)
WITH source, target, sum(r.numberOfPages) AS numberOfPages
WITH gds.alpha.graph.project('readSums', source, target, {}, { properties: { numberOfPages: numberOfPages } }) AS g
RETURN
  g.graphName AS graph, g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph      | nodes  | rels
| "readSums" | 5      | 3
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` were correctly aggregated.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-sum-aggregate]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty('readSums', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY numberOfPages DESC, person
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 46.0
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | 0.0
|===
--

We can see, that the two `READ` relationships between Florentin and the Hobbit sum up to `46` numberOfPages.


=== Projecting filtered Neo4j graphs

Cypher-projections allow us to specify the graph to project in a more fine-grained way.
The following examples will demonstrate how to filter out `READ` relationships if they do not have a `numberOfPages` property.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-rel-filtering-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `READ` relationships where `numberOfPages` is present:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source) OPTIONAL MATCH (source)-[r:READ]->(target)
WHERE r.numberOfPages IS NOT NULL
WITH gds.alpha.graph.project('existingNumberOfPages', source, target, {}, { properties: r { .numberOfPages } }) AS g
RETURN
  g.graphName AS graph, g.nodeCount AS nodes, g.relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph                   | nodes  | rels
| "existingNumberOfPages" | 5      | 3
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` was correctly loaded.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-aggregation-rel-filtering-properties]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` from the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty('existingNumberOfPages', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY person ASC, numberOfPages DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 42.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 4.0
|===
--

If we compare the results to the ones from <<cypher-aggregation-relationship-properties>>, we can see that using `IS NOT NULL` is filtering out the relationship from Veselin to the book Frankenstein.
This functionality is only expressible with <<catalog-graph-project, native projections>> by projecting a <<catalog-graph-project-subgraph,subgraph>>.
