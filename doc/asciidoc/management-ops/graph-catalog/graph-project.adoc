= Creating graphs

[abstract]
--
This section details projecting GDS graphs using `native` projections.
--

A projected graph can be stored in the <<graph-catalog-ops, catalog>> under a user-defined name.
Using that name, the graph can be referred to by any algorithm in the library.
This allows multiple algorithms to use the same graph without having to project it on each algorithm run.

Native projections provide the best performance by reading from the Neo4j store files.
Recommended for both the development, and the production phase.


[NOTE]
--
There is also a way to generate a random graph, see <<graph-generation, Graph Generation>> documentation for more details.
--

[NOTE]
--
The projected graphs will reside in the catalog until:

- the graph is dropped using <<catalog-graph-drop, gds.graph.drop>>
- the Neo4j database from which to graph was projected is stopped or dropped
- the Neo4j database management system is stopped.

[[graph-project-native-syntax]]
== Syntax

A native projection takes three mandatory arguments: `graphName`, `nodeProjection` and `relationshipProjection`.
In addition, the optional `configuration` parameter allows us to further configure the graph creation.

[[graph-project-examples]]
== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS Graph Projection capabilities we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j.
The example graph looks like this:

image::example-graphs/graph-project-example.svg[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),

  (hobbit:Book { name: 'The Hobbit', isbn: 1234, numberOfPages: 310, ratings: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5] }),

  (veselin)-[:READ]->(frankenstein)
----

[[graph-project-example-single-label-type]]
=== Simple graph

A simple graph is a graph with only one node label and relationship type, i.e., a monopartite graph.
We are going to start with demonstrating how to load a simple graph by projecting only the `Person` node label and `KNOWS` relationship type.

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` nodes and `KNOWS` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'persons',            // <1>
  'Person',             // <2>
  'KNOWS'               // <3>
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeProjection, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipProjection, relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> The name of the graph. Afterwards, `persons` can be used to run algorithms or manage the graph.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with the `Person` label.
<3> The relationships to be projected. In this example, the relationships of type `KNOWS`.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1,3m,1m"]
|===
| graph     | nodeProjection                         | nodes  | relationshipProjection                                                        | rels
| "persons" | {Person={label=Person, properties={}}} | 3      | {KNOWS={orientation=NATURAL, aggregation=DEFAULT, type=KNOWS, properties={}}} | 2
|===
--

In the example above, we used a short-hand syntax for the node and relationship projection.
The used projections are internally expanded to the full `Map` syntax as shown in the `Results` table.
In addition, we can see the projected in-memory graph contains three `Person` nodes, and the two `KNOWS` relationships.


=== Multi-graph

A multi-graph is a graph with multiple node labels and relationship types.

To project multiple node labels and relationship types, we can adjust the projections as follows:

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `KNOWS` and `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'personsAndBooks',    // <1>
  ['Person', 'Book'],   // <2>
  ['KNOWS', 'READ']     // <3>
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeProjection, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `personsAndBooks`.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with a `Person` or `Book` label.
<3> The relationships to be projected. In this example, the relationships of type `KNOWS` or `READ`.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graph             | nodeProjection                                                           | nodes  | rels
| "personsAndBooks" | {Book={label=Book, properties={}}, Person={label=Person, properties={}}} | 5      | 6
|===
--

In the example above, we used a short-hand syntax for the node and relationship projection.
The used projections are internally expanded to the full `Map` syntax as shown for the `nodeProjection` in the Results table.
In addition, we can see the projected in-memory graph contains five nodes, and the two relationships.


=== Relationship orientation

By default, relationships are loaded in the same orientation as stored in the Neo4j db.
In GDS, we call this the `NATURAL` orientation.
Additionally, we provide the functionality to load the relationships in the `REVERSE` or even `UNDIRECTED` orientation.

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` nodes and undirected `KNOWS` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'undirectedKnows',                    // <1>
  'Person',                             // <2>
  {KNOWS: {orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'}}  // <3>
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph,
  relationshipProjection AS knowsProjection,
  nodeCount AS nodes,
  relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `undirectedKnows`.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with the Person label.
<3> Projects relationships with type `KNOWS` and specifies that they should be `UNDIRECTED` by using the `orientation` parameter.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graph             | knowsProjection                                                                  | nodes  | rels
| "undirectedKnows" | {KNOWS={orientation=UNDIRECTED, aggregation=DEFAULT, type=KNOWS, properties={}}} | 3      | 4
|===
--

To specify the orientation, we need to write the `relationshipProjection` with the extended Map-syntax.
Projecting the `KNOWS` relationships `UNDIRECTED`, loads each relationship in both directions.
Thus, the `undirectedKnows` graph contains four relationships, twice as many as the `persons` graph in <<graph-project-example-single-label-type>>.


[[node-properties-example]]
=== Node properties

To project node properties, we can either use the `nodeProperties` configuration parameter for shared properties, or extend an individual `nodeProjection` for a specific label.

[role=query-example, group=node-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `KNOWS` and `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'graphWithProperties',                                // <1>
  {                                                     // <2>
    Person: {properties: 'age'},                        // <3>
    Book: {properties: {price: {defaultValue: 5.0}}}    // <4>
  },
  ['KNOWS', 'READ'],                                    // <5>
  {nodeProperties: 'ratings'}                           // <6>
)
YIELD
  graphName, nodeProjection, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
RETURN graphName, nodeProjection.Book AS bookProjection, nodes, rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `graphWithProperties`.
<2> Use the expanded node projection syntax.
<3> Projects nodes with the `Person` label and their `age` property.
<4> Projects nodes with the `Book` label and their `price` property. Each `Book` that doesn't have the `price` property will get the `defaultValue` of `5.0`.
<5> The relationships to be projected. In this example, the relationships of type `KNOWS` or `READ`.
<6> The global configuration, projects node property `rating` on each of the specified labels.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graphName             | bookProjection                                                           | nodes  | rels
| "graphWithProperties" | {label=Book, properties={price={defaultValue=5.0, property=price}, ratings={defaultValue=null, property=ratings}}} | 5      | 6
|===
--

The projected `graphWithProperties` graph contains five nodes and six relationships.
In the returned `bookProjection` we can observe, the node properties `price` and `ratings` are loaded for `Books`.

NOTE: GDS currently only supports loading numeric properties.

Further, the `price` property has a default value of `5.0`.
Not every book has a price specified in the example graph.
In the following we check if the price was correctly projected:

[role=query-example, group=node-properties]
--
.Verify the ratings property of Adam in the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Book)
RETURN n.name AS name, gds.util.nodeProperty('graphWithProperties', id(n), 'price') as price
ORDER BY price
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1"]
|===
| name          | price
| "The Hobbit"  | 5.0
| "Frankenstein"| 19.99
|===
--

We can see, that the price was projected with the Hobbit having the default price of 5.0.


=== Relationship properties

Analogous to node properties, we can either use the `relationshipProperties` configuration parameter or extend an individual `relationshipProjection` for a specific type.

[role=query-example, group=rel-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `READ` relationships with `numberOfPages` property:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'readWithProperties',                     // <1>
  ['Person', 'Book'],                       // <2>
  {                                         // <3>
    READ: { properties: "numberOfPages" }   // <4>
  }
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph,
  relationshipProjection AS readProjection,
  nodeCount AS nodes,
  relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `readWithProperties`.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with a `Person` or `Book` label.
<3> Use the expanded relationship projection syntax.
<4> Project relationships of type `READ` and their `numberOfPages` property.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graph                | readProjection                                                                                                                                            | nodes  | rels
| "readWithProperties" | {READ={orientation=NATURAL, aggregation=DEFAULT, type=READ, properties={numberOfPages={defaultValue=null, property=numberOfPages, aggregation=DEFAULT}}}} | 5      | 4
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` were correctly loaded.

[role=query-example, group=rel-properties]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty('readWithProperties', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY person ASC, numberOfPages DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 42.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 4.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | NaN
|===
--

We can see, that the `numberOfPages` property is loaded. The default property value is `Double.NaN` and could be changed using the Map-Syntax the same as for node properties in <<node-properties-example>>.


=== Parallel relationships

Neo4j supports parallel relationships, i.e., multiple relationships between two nodes.
By default, GDS preserves parallel relationships.
For some algorithms, we want the projected graph to contain at most one relationship between two nodes.

We can specify how parallel relationships should be aggregated into a single relationship via the `aggregation` parameter in a relationship projection.

For graphs without relationship properties, we can use the `COUNT` aggregation.
If we do not need the count, we could use the `SINGLE` aggregation.

// special case: COUNT example
[role=query-example, group=count-aggregate]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `COUNT` aggregated `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'readCount',                      // <1>
  ['Person', 'Book'],               // <2>
  {
    READ: {                         // <3>

----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `readCount`.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with a `Person` or `Book` label.
<3> Project relationships of type `READ`.
<4> Project relationship property `numberOfReads`.
<5> A placeholder, signaling that the value of the relationship property is derived and not based on Neo4j property.
<6> The aggregation type. In this example, `COUNT` results in the value of the property being the number of parallel relationships.

Next, we will verify that the `READ` relationships were correctly aggregated.

[role=query-example, group=count-aggregate]

.Stream the relationship property `numberOfReads` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty('readCount', 'numberOfReads')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfReads
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfReads
ORDER BY numberOfReads DESC, person
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                  | numberOfReads
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 2.0
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 1.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | 1.0
|===
--

We can see, that the two READ relationships between Florentin, and the Hobbit result in `2` numberOfReads.


=== Parallel relationships with properties

For graphs with relationship properties we can also use other aggregations.

[role=query-example, group=sum-aggregate]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and aggregated `READ` relationships by summing the `numberOfPages`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'readSums',                                                   // <1>
  ['Person', 'Book'],                                           // <2>
  {READ: {properties: {numberOfPages: {aggregation: 'SUM'}}}}   // <3>
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph,
  relationshipProjection AS readProjection,
  nodeCount AS nodes,
  relationshipCount AS rels
----
<1> Projects a graph under the name `readSums`.
<2> The nodes to be projected. In this example, the nodes with a `Person` or `Book` label.
<3> Project relationships of type `READ`. Aggregation type `SUM` results in a projected `numberOfPages` property with its value being the sum of the `numberOfPages` properties of the parallel relationships.

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graph      | readProjection                                                                  | nodes  | rels
| "readSums" | {READ={orientation=NATURAL, aggregation=DEFAULT, type=READ, properties={numberOfPages={defaultValue=null, property=numberOfPages, aggregation=SUM}}}} | 5      | 3
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` was correctly aggregated.

[role=query-example, group=sum-aggregate]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty('readSums', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD
  sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY numberOfPages DESC, person
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 46.0
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | 0.0
|===
--

We can see, that the two READ relationships between Florentin and the Hobbit sum up to `46` numberOfReads.


=== Validate relationships flag

As mentioned in the <<graph-project-native-syntax, syntax section>>, the `validateRelationships` flag controls whether an error will be raised when attempting to project a relationship where either the source or target node is not present in the <<node-projection-syntax, node projection>>.
Note that even if the flag is set to `false` such a relationship will still not be projected but the loading process will not be aborted.

We can simulate such a case with the <<graph-project-examples, graph present in the Neo4j database>>:

--
.Project `READ` and `KNOWS` relationships but only `Person` nodes, with `validateRelationships` set to true:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'danglingRelationships',
  'Person',
  ['READ', 'KNOWS'],
  {
    validateRelationships: true
  }
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph,
  relationshipProjection AS readProjection,
  nodeCount AS nodes,
  relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
----
org.neo4j.graphdb.QueryExecutionException: Failed to invoke procedure `gds.graph.project`: Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Failed to load a relationship because its target-node with id 3 is not part of the node query or projection. To ignore the relationship, set the configuration parameter `validateRelationships` to false.
----
--

We can see that the above query resulted in an exception being thrown.
The exception message will provide information about the specific node id that was missing, which will help debugging underlying problems.
