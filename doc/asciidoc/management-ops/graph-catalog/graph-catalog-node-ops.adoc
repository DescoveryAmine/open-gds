= Node operations

[abstract]
--
This section details the operations available over node-properties stored in projected graphs within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

The graphs in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library support properties for nodes.
We provide multiple operations to work with the stored node-properties in projected graphs.
Node properties are either added during the graph projection or when using the `mutate` mode of our graph algorithms.

To inspect stored values, the `gds.graph.streamNodeProperties` procedure can be used.
This is useful if we ran multiple algorithms in `mutate` mode and want to retrieve some or all of the results.

To persist the values in a Neo4j database, we can use `gds.graph.writeNodeProperties`.
Similar to streaming node properties, it is also possible to write those back to Neo4j.
This is similar to what an algorithm `write` execution mode does, but allows more fine-grained control over the operations.

We can also remove node properties from a named graph in the catalog.
This is useful to free up main memory or to remove accidentally added node properties.

[[node-ops-examples]]
== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS capabilities over node properties, we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j and project it into our graph catalog.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),
  (veselin:Person { name: 'Veselin', age: 20 }),
  (hobbit:Book { name: 'The Hobbit', numberOfPages: 310 }),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2010 }]->(adam),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2018 }]->(veselin),
  (adam)-[:READ]->(hobbit)
----

.Project the small social network graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'socialGraph',
  {
    Person: {properties: "age"},
    Book: {}
  },
  ['KNOWS', 'READ']
)
----

.Compute the Degree Centrality in our social graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.degree.mutate('socialGraph', {mutateProperty: 'score'})
----

=== Stream

We can stream node properties stored in a named in-memory graph back to the user.
This is useful if we ran multiple algorithms in `mutate` mode and want to retrieve some or all of the results.
This is similar to what an algorithm `stream` execution mode does, but allows more fine-grained control over the operations.

[[catalog-graph-stream-single-node-property-example]]
==== Single property

In the following, we stream the previously computed scores `score`.

[role=query-example]
--
.Stream the `score` node property:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamNodeProperty('socialGraph', 'score')
YIELD nodeId, propertyValue
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, propertyValue AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name         | score
| "Florentin"  | 2.0
| "Adam"       | 1.0
| "Veselin"    | 0.0
| "The Hobbit" | 0.0
|===
--

NOTE: The above example requires all given properties to be present on at least one node projection, and the properties will be streamed for all such projections.


==== NodeLabels

The procedure can be configured to stream just the properties for specific node labels.

[role=query-example]
--
.Stream the `score` property for `Person` nodes:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamNodeProperty('socialGraph', 'score', ['Person'])
YIELD nodeId, propertyValue
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, propertyValue AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name        | score
| "Florentin" | 2.0
| "Adam"      | 1.0
| "Veselin"   | 0.0
|===
--

It is required, that all specified node labels have the node property.

[[catalog-graph-stream-node-properties-example]]
==== Multiple Properties

We can also stream several properties at once.

[role=query-example]
--
.Stream multiple node properties:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamNodeProperties('socialGraph', ['score', 'age'])
YIELD nodeId, nodeProperty, propertyValue
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, nodeProperty, propertyValue
ORDER BY name, nodeProperty
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name         | nodeProperty  | propertyValue
| "Adam"       | "age"         | 18
| "Adam"       | "score"       | 1.0
| "Florentin"  | "age"         | 16
| "Florentin"  | "score"       | 2.0
| "Veselin"    | "age"         | 20
| "Veselin"    | "score"       | 0.0
|===
--

[NOTE]
====
When streaming multiple node properties, the name of each property is included in the result.
This adds with some overhead, as each property name must be repeated for each node in the result, but is necessary in order to distinguish properties.
====

[[catalog-graph-write-node-properties-example]]
=== Write

To write the 'score' property for all node labels in the social graph, we use the following query:

[role=query-example]
--
.Write the `score` property back to Neo4j:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.writeNodeProperties('socialGraph', ['score'])
YIELD propertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| propertiesWritten
| 4
|===
--

The above example requires the `score` property to be present on _at least one_ projected node label, and the properties will be written for all such labels.

==== NodeLabels

The procedure can be configured to write just the properties for some specific node labels.
In the following example, we will only write back the scores of the `Person` nodes.

[role=query-example]
--
.Write node properties of a specific projected node label to Neo4j:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.writeNodeProperties('socialGraph', ['score'], ['Person'])
YIELD propertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| propertiesWritten
| 3
|===
--

[NOTE]
--
If the `nodeLabels` parameter is specified, it is required that _all_ given node labels have _all_ of the given properties.
--


[[catalog-graph-remove-node-properties-example]]
=== Remove


[role=query-example]
--
.Remove the `score` property from all projected nodes in the `socialGraph`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.removeNodeProperties('socialGraph', ['score'])
YIELD propertiesRemoved
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| propertiesRemoved
| 4
|===
--

[NOTE]
--
The above example requires all given properties to be present on _at least one_ projected node label.
--

==== NodeLabels

Consider we compute the Degree Centrality only for a subset of the graph.

.Compute the Degree Centrality for only the `Book` nodes in our social graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.degree.mutate('socialGraph', {nodeLabels: ['Book'], mutateProperty: 'degree'})
----

The procedure can be configured to remove just the properties for s.
In the following example, we will only remove the scores from the `Book` nodes.

[role=query-example]
--
.Remove the `degree` property from the projected `Book` nodes:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.removeNodeProperties('socialGraph', ['degree'], ['Book'])
YIELD propertiesRemoved
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| propertiesRemoved
| 1
|===
--

[NOTE]
--
If the `nodeLabels` parameter is specified, it is required that _all_ given node labels have _all_ of the given properties.
--

== Utility functions

Utility functions allow accessing specific nodes of in-memory graphs directly from a Cypher query.

.Catalog Functions
[opts=header,cols="1m,1"]
|===

|===
| Name                                                                                               | Description
| gds.util.nodeProperty(graphName: STRING, nodeId: INTEGER, propertyKey: STRING, nodeLabel: STRING?) | Named graph in the catalog, Neo4j node id, node property key and optional node label present in the named-graph.
|===

If a node label is given, the property value for the corresponding projection and the given node is returned.
If no label or `'*'` is given, the property value is retrieved and returned from an arbitrary projection that contains the given propertyKey.
If the property value is missing for the given node, `null` is returned.


=== Examples

We use the `socialGraph` with the property `score` introduced <<node-ops-examples, above>>.

[role=query-example]
--
.Access a property node property for Florentin:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (florentin:Person {name: 'Florentin'})
RETURN
  florentin.name AS name,
  gds.util.nodeProperty('socialGraph', id(florentin), 'score') AS score
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="2"]
|===
| name        | score
| "Florentin" | 2.0
|===
--

We can also specifically return the `score` property from the `Person` projection in case other projections also have a `score` property as follows.

[role=query-example]
--
.Access a property node property from Person for Florentin:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (florentin:Person {name: 'Florentin'})
RETURN
  florentin.name AS name,
  gds.util.nodeProperty('socialGraph', id(florentin), 'score', 'Person') AS score
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="2"]
|===
| name        | score
| "Florentin" | 2.0
