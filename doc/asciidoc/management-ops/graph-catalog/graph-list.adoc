= Listing graphs

[abstract]
--
This section details how to list graphs stored in the graph catalog of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Information about graphs in the catalog can be retrieved using the `gds.graph.list()` procedure.


== Syntax

[.graph-list-syntax]

.List information about graphs in the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.list(

The information contains basic statistics about the graph, e.g., the node and relationship count.
The result field `creationTime` indicates when the graph was projected in memory.
The result field `modificationTime` indicates when the graph was updated by an algorithm running in `mutate` mode.

The `database` column refers to the name of the database the corresponding graph has been projected on.
Referring to a named graph in a procedure is only allowed on the database it has been projected on.

The `schema` consists of information about the nodes and relationships stored in the graph.
For each node label, the schema maps the label to its property keys and their corresponding property types.
Similarly, the schema maps the relationship types to their property keys and property types.
The property type is either `Integer`, `Float`, `List of Integer` or `List of Float`.

The `degreeDistribution` field can be fairly time-consuming to compute for larger graphs.
Its computation is cached per graph, so subsequent listing for the same graph will be fast.
To avoid computing the degree distribution, specify a `YIELD` clause that omits it.
Note that not specifying a `YIELD` clause is the same as requesting all possible return fields to be returned.

The `density` is the result of `relationshipCount` divided by the maximal number of relationships for a simple graph with the given `nodeCount`.


== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS Graph List capabilities we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),
  (veselin:Person { name: 'Veselin', age: 20 }),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2010 }]->(adam),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2018 }]->(veselin)
----

Additionally, we will project a few graphs to the graph catalog, for more details see <<catalog-graph-project, native projections>> and <<catalog-graph-project-cypher, Cypher projections>>.

.Project `Person` nodes and `KNOWS` relationships using native projections:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project('personsNative', 'Person', 'KNOWS')
----

.Project `Person` nodes and `KNOWS` relationships using Cypher projections:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'personsCypher',
  'MATCH (n:Person) RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) as labels',
  'MATCH (n:Person)-[r:KNOWS]->(m:Person) RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) as type')
----

.Project `Person` nodes with property `age` and `KNOWS` relationships using Native projections:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'personsWithAgeNative',
  {
    Person: {properties: 'age'}
  },
  'KNOWS'
)
----

=== List basic information about all graphs in the catalog

[role=query-example]
--
.List basic information about all graphs in the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
RETURN graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
ORDER BY graphName ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graphName              | nodeCount   | relationshipCount
| "personsCypher"        | 3           | 2
| "personsNative"        | 3           | 2
| "personsWithAgeNative" | 3           | 2
|===

=== List extended information about a specific named graph in the catalog

[role=query-example]
--
.List extended information about a specific Cypher named graph in the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.list('personsCypher')
YIELD graphName, configuration
RETURN graphName, configuration.nodeQuery AS nodeQuery
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName | nodeQuery
| "personsCypher"
| "MATCH (n:Person) RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) as labels"
|===
--

[role=query-example]
--
.List extended information about a specific native named graph in the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.list('personsNative')
YIELD graphName, configuration
RETURN graphName, configuration.nodeProjection AS nodeProjection
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName       | nodeProjection
| "personsNative"
| {Person={label=Person, properties={}}}
|===
--

The above examples demonstrate that `nodeQuery` only has value when the graph is projected using Cypher projection while `nodeProjection` is present when we have a native graph.
This is also true for `relationshipQuery` and relationshipProjection` respectively.

Despite different result columns being present for the different projections that we can use the Graph Schemas are the same, which is demonstrated in the example below.

[role=query-example]

.Cypher graph schema:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.list('personsCypher')
YIELD graphName, schema
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="2,8"]
|===
| graphName | schema
| "personsCypher"
| {relationships={KNOWS={}}, nodes={Person={}}}
|===
--

[role=query-example]
--
.Native graph schema:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.list('personsNative')
YIELD graphName, schema
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="2,8"]
|===
| graphName       | schema
| "personsNative"
| {relationships={KNOWS={}}, nodes={Person={}}}
|===

=== Degree distribution of a specific graph

[role=query-example]
--
.List information about the degree distribution of a specific graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.list('personsNative')
YIELD graphName, degreeDistribution;
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="2,8"]
|===
| graphName       | degreeDistribution
| "personsNative"
| {p99=2, min=0, max=2, mean=0.6666666666666666, p90=2, p50=0, p999=2, p95=2, p75=0}
