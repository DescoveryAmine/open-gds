= Relationship operations

[abstract]
--
This section details the operations available over relationships and relationship properties stored in projected graphs within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

The graphs in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library support properties for relationships.
We provide multiple operations to work with the stored relationship-properties in projected graphs.
Relationship properties are either added during the graph projection or when using the `mutate` mode of our graph algorithms.

To inspect stored relationship property values, the `streamRelationshipProperties` procedure can be used.
This is useful if we ran multiple algorithms in `mutate` mode and want to retrieve some or all of the results.

To persist relationship types in a Neo4j database, we can use `gds.graph.writeRelationship`.
Similar to streaming relationship properties, it is also possible to write back to Neo4j.
This is similar to what an algorithm `write` execution mode does, but allows more fine-grained control over the operations.
By default, no relationship properties will be written. To write relationship properties, these have to be explicitly specified.

We can also remove relationships from a named graph in the catalog.
This is useful to free up main memory or to remove accidentally added relationship types.

== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS capabilities over node properties, we are going to create a small graph in Neo4j and project it into our graph catalog.

image::example-graphs/node-similarity.svg[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (bob:Person {name: 'Bob'}),
  (carol:Person {name: 'Carol'}),
  (dave:Person {name: 'Dave'}),
  (eve:Person {name: 'Eve'}),
  (guitar:Instrument {name: 'Guitar'}),
  (synth:Instrument {name: 'Synthesizer'}),
  (bongos:Instrument {name: 'Bongos'}),
  (trumpet:Instrument {name: 'Trumpet'}),

  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(guitar),
  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 4 }]->(synth),
  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 3, strength: 0.5}]->(bongos),
  (bob)-[:LIKES { score: 4 }]->(guitar),
  (bob)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(synth),
  (carol)-[:LIKES { score: 2 }]->(bongos),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 3 }]->(guitar),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 1 }]->(synth),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(bongos)
----

.Project the graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'personsAndInstruments',
  ['Person', 'Instrument'],         // <1>
  {
    LIKES: {
      type: 'LIKES',                // <2>
      properties: {
        strength: {                 // <3>
          property: 'strength',
          defaultValue: 1.0
        },
        score: {
          property: 'score'         // <4>
        }
      }
    }
  }
)
----
<1> Project node labels `Person` and `Instrument`.
<2> Project relationship type `LIKES`.
<3> Project property `strength` of relationship type `LIKES` setting a default value of `1.0` because not all relationships have that property.
<4> Project property `score` of relationship type `LIKES`.

.Compute the Node Similarity in our graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.nodeSimilarity.mutate('personsAndInstruments', {   // <1>
  mutateRelationshipType: 'SIMILAR',                        // <2>
  mutateProperty: 'score'                                   // <3>
})
----
<1> Run NodeSimilarity in `mutate` mode on `personsAndInstruments` projected graph.
<2> The algorithm will add relationships of type `SIMILAR` to the projected graph.
<3> The algorithm will add relationship property `score` for each added relationship.


=== Stream

[[catalog-graph-stream-single-relationship-property-example]]
==== Single property

The most basic case for streaming relationship information from a named graph is a single property.
In the example below we stream the relationship property `score`.

[role=query-example]
--
.Stream a single relationship property:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty(
  'personsAndInstruments',                  // <1>
  'score'                                   // <2>
)
YIELD
  sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, relationshipType, propertyValue
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name as source, gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name as target, relationshipType, propertyValue
ORDER BY source ASC, target ASC
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> The property we want to stream out.

| "Carol" | "Dave"        | "SIMILAR"         | 0.3333333333333333
| "Dave"  | "Alice"       | "SIMILAR"         | 1.0
| "Dave"  | "Bob"         | "SIMILAR"         | 0.6666666666666666
| "Dave"  | "Bongos"      | "LIKES"           | 5.0
| "Dave"  | "Carol"       | "SIMILAR"         | 0.3333333333333333
| "Dave"  | "Guitar"      | "LIKES"           | 3.0
| "Dave"  | "Synthesizer" | "LIKES"           | 1.0
|===
--

As we can see from the results, we get two relationship types (`SIMILAR` and `LIKES`) that have the `score` relationship property.
We can further on filter the relationship types we want to stream, this is demonstrated in the next example.

  ['SIMILAR']                               // <3>
)
YIELD
  sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, relationshipType, propertyValue
RETURN

NOTE: The properties we want to stream must exist for each specified relationship type.

[[catalog-graph-write-relationship-example]]
=== Write

We can write relationships stored in a named in-memory graph back to Neo4j.
This can be used to write algorithm results (for example from <<algorithms-node-similarity, Node Similarity>>) or relationships that have been aggregated during graph creation.

The relationships to write are specified by a relationship type.

NOTE: Relationships are always written using a single thread.

==== Relationship type

[role=query-example]
--
.Write relationships to Neo4j:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.writeRelationship(
  'personsAndInstruments',        // <1>
  'SIMILAR'                       // <2>
)
YIELD
  graphName, relationshipType, relationshipProperty, relationshipsWritten, propertiesWritten
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> The relationship type we want to write back to the Neo4j database.

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName               | relationshipType | relationshipProperty | relationshipsWritten | propertiesWritten
| "personsAndInstruments" | "SIMILAR"        | null                 | 10                   | 0
|===
--

By default, no relationship properties will be written, as it can be seen from the results, the `relationshipProperty` value is `null` and `propertiesWritten` are `0`.

Here is an illustration of how the example graph looks in Neo4j after executing the example above.

image::write_relationships_graph.svg[Visualization of the example graph after writing relationships back,align="center"]

The `SIMILAR` relationships have been added to the underlying database and can be used in Cypher queries or for projecting to in-memory graph for running algorithms.
The relationships in this example are undirected because we used <<algorithms-node-similarity, Node Similarity>> to mutate the in-memory graph and this algorithm creates undirected relationships, this may not be the case if we use different algorithms.


==== Relationship type with property

To write relationship properties, these have to be explicitly specified.

[role=query-example]
--
.Write relationships and their properties to Neo4j:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.writeRelationship(
  'personsAndInstruments',          // <1>
  'SIMILAR',                        // <2>
  'score'                           // <3>
)
YIELD
  graphName, relationshipType, relationshipProperty, relationshipsWritten, propertiesWritten
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> The relationship type we want to write back to the Neo4j database.
<3> The property name of the relationship we want to write back to the Neo4j database.

.Results
[opts="header"]

| graphName               | relationshipType | relationshipProperty | relationshipsWritten | propertiesWritten
| "personsAndInstruments" | "SIMILAR"        | "score"              | 10                   | 10

[[catalog-graph-delete-rel-type]]
=== Delete

We can delete all relationships of a given type from a named graph in the catalog.
This is useful to free up main memory or to remove accidentally added relationship types.

[NOTE]
====
Deleting relationships of a given type is only possible if it is not the last relationship type present in the graph.
If we still want to delete these relationships we need to <<catalog-graph-drop, drop the graph>> instead.

  'SIMILAR'                           // <2>
