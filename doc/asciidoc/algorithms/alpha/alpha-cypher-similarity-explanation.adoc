If the similarity lists are very large they can take up a lot of memory.
For cases where those lists contain lots of values that should be skipped, you can use the less memory-intensive approach of using Cypher statements to project the graph instead.

The Cypher projection expects to receive 3 fields:

* `item` - should contain node ids, which we can return using the `id` function.
* `category` - should contain node ids, which we can return using the `id` function.
* `weight` - should contain a double value.
