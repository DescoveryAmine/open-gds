This chapter provides explanations and examples for the node embedding algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

Node embedding algorithms compute low-dimensional vector representations of nodes in a graph.
These vectors, also called embeddings, can be used for machine learning.
The Neo4j Graph Data Science library contains the following node embedding algorithms:

* Production-quality
** <<algorithms-embeddings-fastrp, FastRP>>

* Beta
** <<algorithms-embeddings-graph-sage, GraphSAGE>>
** <<beta-algorithms-embeddings-node2vec, Node2Vec>>
