| Name                                                                             | Type    | Default | Optional | Description
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String  | null    | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| <<common-configuration-seed-property,seedProperty>>                              | String  | n/a     | yes      | Used to set the initial component for a node. The property value needs to be a number.
| threshold                                                                        | Float   | null    | yes      | The value of the weight above which the relationship is considered in the computation.
| consecutiveIds                                                                   | Boolean | false   | yes      | Flag to decide whether component identifiers are mapped into a consecutive id space (requires additional memory).
| minComponentSize                                                                 | Integer  | 0      | yes      | Only component ids of components with a size greater than or equal to the given value are written to Neo4j.
