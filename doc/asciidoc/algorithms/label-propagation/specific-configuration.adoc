| <<common-configuration-max-iterations,maxIterations>>                            | Integer | 10                     | yes      | The maximum number of iterations to run.
| <<common-configuration-node-weight-property,nodeWeightProperty>>                 | String  | null                   | yes      | The name of a node property that contains node weights.
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String  | null                   | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
