Algorithms exist in one of three tiers of maturity:

* Production-quality
** Indicates that the algorithm has been tested with regards to stability and scalability.
** Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.<algorithm>`.
* Beta
** Indicates that the algorithm is a candidate for the production-quality tier.
** Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.beta.<algorithm>`.
* Alpha
** Indicates that the algorithm is experimental and might be changed or removed at any time.
** Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.alpha.<algorithm>`.
