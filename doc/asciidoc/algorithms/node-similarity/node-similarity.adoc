== Introduction

The Node Similarity algorithm compares a set of nodes based on the nodes they are connected to.
Two nodes are considered similar if they share many of the same neighbors.
Node Similarity computes pair-wise similarities based on the Jaccard metric, also known as the Jaccard Similarity Score.

Given two sets `A` and `B`, the Jaccard Similarity is computed using the following formula:

image::jaccard.png[role="middle"]
// This is the raw information for this image:
// // J(A,B) = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣(A ∪ B)∣ // = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣A∣ + ∣B∣ - ∣A ∩ B| //

The input of this algorithm is a bipartite, connected graph containing two disjoint node sets.
Each relationship starts from a node in the first node set and ends at a node in the second node set.

The Node Similarity algorithm compares each node that has outgoing relationships with each other such node.
For every node `n`, we collect the outgoing neighborhood `N(n)` of that node, that is, all nodes `m` such that there is a relationship from `n` to `m`.
For each pair `n`, `m`, the algorithm computes a similarity for that pair which is the Jaccard similarity of `N(n)` and `N(m)`.

The complexity of this comparison grows quadratically with the number of nodes to compare.
The algorithm reduces the complexity by ignoring disconnected nodes.

In addition to computational complexity, the memory requirement for producing results also scales roughly quadratically.
In order to bound memory usage, the algorithm requires an explicit limit on the number of results to compute per node.
This is the 'topK' parameter.
It can be set to any value, except 0.

The output of the algorithm are new relationships between pairs of the first node set.
Similarity scores are expressed via relationship properties.

A related function for computing Jaccard similarity is described in <<alpha-algorithms-similarity-jaccard>>.

== Examples

:algorithm-name: {algorithm}

:image-file: node-similarity.svg
include::../shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (bob:Person {name: 'Bob'}),
  (carol:Person {name: 'Carol'}),
  (dave:Person {name: 'Dave'}),
  (eve:Person {name: 'Eve'}),
  (guitar:Instrument {name: 'Guitar'}),
  (synth:Instrument {name: 'Synthesizer'}),
  (bongos:Instrument {name: 'Bongos'}),
  (trumpet:Instrument {name: 'Trumpet'}),

  (alice)-[:LIKES]->(guitar),
  (alice)-[:LIKES]->(synth),
  (alice)-[:LIKES {strength: 0.5}]->(bongos),
  (bob)-[:LIKES]->(guitar),
  (bob)-[:LIKES]->(synth),
  (carol)-[:LIKES]->(bongos),
  (dave)-[:LIKES]->(guitar),
  (dave)-[:LIKES]->(synth),
  (dave)-[:LIKES]->(bongos);
----

This bipartite graph has two node sets, Person nodes and Instrument nodes.
The two node sets are connected via LIKES relationships.
Each relationship starts at a Person node and ends at an Instrument node.

In the example, we want to use the Node Similarity algorithm to compare people based on the instruments they like.

The Node Similarity algorithm will only compute similarity for nodes that have a degree of at least 1.
In the example graph, the Eve node will not be compared to other Person nodes.

include::../shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'myGraph',
    ['Person', 'Instrument'],
    {
        LIKES: {
            type: 'LIKES',
            properties: {
                strength: {
                    property: 'strength',
                    defaultValue: 1.0
                }
            }

We use default values for the procedure configuration parameter.
TopK is set to 10, topN is set to 0.
Because of that the result set contains the top 10 similarity scores for each node.

[NOTE]
====
If we would like to instead compare the Instruments to each other, we would then project the `LIKES` relationship type using `REVERSE` orientation.
This would return similarities for pairs of Instruments and not compute any similarities between Persons.

As we can see from the results, the number of created relationships is equal to the number of rows in the streaming example.

[NOTE]
====
The relationships that are produced by the mutation are always directed, even if the input graph is undirected.
If `a -> b` is topK for `a` and symmetrically `b -> a` is topK for `b` (or both `a -> b` and `b -> a` are topN), it appears as though an undirected relationship is produced.
However, they are just two directed relationships that have been independently produced.
====


[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-write]]
=== Write

The `write` execution mode extends the `stats` mode with an important side effect: for each pair of nodes we create a relationship with the Jaccard similarity score as a property to the Neo4j database.
The type of the new relationship is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeRelationshipType`.
The name of the new property is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeProperty`.
The result is a single summary row, similar to `stats`, but with some additional metrics.

For more details on the `write` mode in general, see <<running-algos-write>>.

[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-limits]]
=== Limit results

There are four limits that can be applied to the similarity results.
Top limits the result to the highest similarity scores.
Bottom limits the result to the lowest similarity scores.
Both top and bottom limits can apply to the result as a whole ("N"), or to the result per node ("K").

[NOTE]
====
There must always be a "K" limit, either bottomK or topK, which is a positive number.
The default value for topK and bottomK is 10.

[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-limits-topk-bottomk]]
==== topK and bottomK

TopK and bottomK are limits on the number of scores computed per node.
For topK, the K largest similarity scores per node are returned.
For bottomK, the K smallest similarity scores per node are returned.
TopK and bottomK cannot be 0, used in conjunction, and the default value is 10.
If neither is specified, topK is used.

[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-limits-topn-bottomn]]
==== topN and bottomN

TopN and bottomN limit the number of similarity scores across all nodes.
This is a limit on the total result set, in addition to the topK or bottomK limit on the results per node.
For topN, the N largest similarity scores are returned.
For bottomN, the N smallest similarity scores are returned.
A value of 0 means no global limit is imposed and all results from topK or bottomK are returned.

[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-degree-similarity-cutoff]]
=== Degree cutoff and similarity cutoff

Degree cutoff is a lower limit on the node degree for a node to be considered in the comparisons.
This value can not be lower than 1.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]

[opts="header"]
|===
| Person1 | Person2 | similarity
| "Alice" | "Dave"  | 1.0
| "Dave"  | "Alice" | 1.0

--

Similarity cutoff is a lower limit for the similarity score to be present in the result.
The default value is very small (`1E-42`) to exclude results with a similarity score of 0.

[NOTE]
====
Setting similarity cutoff to 0 may yield a very large result set, increased runtime and memory consumption.

[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-weighted]]

Relationship properties can be used to modify the similarity induced by certain relationships.
For example a relationship value of 2 is equal to counting that relationship twice while computing the jaccard similarity.

Weighted jaccard similarity is only defined for values greater or equal to 0.

|===
--

It can be seen that the similarity between Alice and Dave decreased compared to the non-weighted version of this algorithm.
This is the case as the strength of the relationship between Alice and Bongos is reduced and both persons now only share 2.5 out of 3 possible instruments.
Analogous the similarity between Alice and Bob increased as the missing liked instrument has a lower impact on the similarity score.
