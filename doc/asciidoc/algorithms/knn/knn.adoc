[[algorithms-knn-intro]]
== Introduction

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm computes a distance value for all node pairs in the graph and creates new relationships between each node and its k nearest neighbors.
The distance is calculated based on node properties.

The input of this algorithm is a monopartite graph.
The graph does not need to be connected, in fact, existing relationships between nodes will be ignored - apart from random walk sampling if that that initial sampling option is used.
New relationships are created between each node and its k nearest neighbors.

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm compares given properties of each node.
The `k` nodes where these properties are most similar are the k-nearest neighbors.

The initial set of neighbors is picked at random and verified and refined in multiple iterations.
The number of iterations is limited by the configuration parameter `maxIterations`.
The algorithm may stop earlier if the neighbor lists only change by a small amount, which can be controlled by the configuration parameter `deltaThreshold`.

The particular implementation is based on https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1963405.1963487[Efficient k-nearest neighbor graph construction for generic similarity measures] by Wei Dong et al.
Instead of comparing every node with every other node, the algorithm selects possible neighbors based on the assumption, that the neighbors-of-neighbors of a node are most likely already the nearest one.
The algorithm scales quasi-linear with respect to the node count, instead of being quadratic.

Furthermore, the algorithm only compares a sample of all possible neighbors on each iteration, assuming that eventually all possible neighbors will be seen.
This can be controlled with the configuration parameter `sampleRate`:

* A valid sample rate must be in between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).
* The default value is `0.5`.
* The parameter is used to control the trade-off between accuracy and runtime-performance.
* A higher sample rate will increase the accuracy of the result.
** The algorithm will also require more memory and will take longer to compute.
* A lower sample rate will increase the runtime-performance.
** Some potential nodes may be missed in the comparison and may not be included in the result.

When encountered neighbors have equal similarity to the least similar already known neighbor, randomly selecting which node to keep can reduce the risk of some neighborhoods not being explored.
This behavior is controlled by the configuration parameter `perturbationRate`.

The output of the algorithm are new relationships between nodes and their k-nearest neighbors.
Similarity scores are expressed via relationship properties.

[[algorithms-knn-introduction-similarity]]
=== Similarity measures

The similarity measure used in the KNN algorithm depends on the type of the configured node properties.
KNN supports both scalar numeric values and lists of numbers.

Scalar numeric property::

When a property is a scalar number, the similarity is computed as one divided by one plus the absolute difference between the values:

image::equations/knn-scalar-similarity.svg[one divided by one plus the absolute difference of ps and pt,align="center"]

List of integers::

When a property is a list of integers, the similarity is computed as one divided by  one plus the number of unequal numbers in the list:

image::equations/knn-integer-list-similarity.svg[one divided by one plus delta of ps and pt,align="center"]

List of floating-point numbers::

When a property is a list of floating-point numbers, the similarity is computed using the cosine similarity metric.
See the <<algorithms-similarity-cosine-context, Cosine Similarity>> algorithm for more details.
If the cosine similarity is negative, we clip the value to `0`, i.e., `max(cosine(a, b), 0))`.

Multiple properties::

Finally, when multiple properties are specified, the similarity of the two neighbors is the mean of the similarities of the individual properties.


[[algorithms-knn-introduction-sampling]]
=== Initial neighbor sampling

The algorithm starts off by picking `k` random neighbors for each node.
There are two options for how this random sampling can be done.

Uniform::

The first `k` neighbors for each node are chosen uniformly at random from all other nodes in the graph.
This is the classic way of doing the initial sampling.
It is also the algorithm's default.
Note that this method does not actually use the topology of the input graph.

Random Walk::

From each node we take a depth biased random walk and choose the first `k` unique nodes we visit on that walk as our initial random neighbors.
If after some internally defined `O(k)` number of steps a random walk, `k` unique neighbors have not been visited, we will fill in the remaining neighbors using the uniform method described above.
The random walk method makes use of the input graph's topology and may be suitable if it is more likely to find good similarity scores between topologically close nodes.

[NOTE]
====
The random walk used is biased towards depth in the sense that it will more likely choose to go further away from its previously visited node, rather that go back to it or to a node equidistant to it.
The intuition of this bias is that subsequent iterations of comparing neighbor-of-neighbors will likely cover the extended (topological) neighborhood of each node.

[NOTE]
====
The KNN algorithm does not read any relationships, but the values for `relationshipProjection` or `relationshipQuery` are still being used and respected for the graph loading.

include::knn-specific-algo-config.adoc[]

The results are the same as running write mode on a named graph, see <<algorithms-knn-syntax, write mode syntax above>>.

[NOTE]
====
To get a deterministic result when running the algorithm:

* the `concurrency` parameter must be set to one
* the `randomSeed` must be explicitly set.

== Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE (alice:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 24})
CREATE (bob:Person {name: 'Bob', age: 73})
CREATE (carol:Person {name: 'Carol', age: 24})
CREATE (dave:Person {name: 'Dave', age: 48})
CREATE (eve:Person {name: 'Eve', age: 67});
----

In the example, we want to use the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to compare people based on their age.

We use default values for the procedure configuration parameter for most parameters.
The `randomSeed` and `concurrency` is set to produce the same result on every invocation.
The `topK` parameter is set to 1 to only return the single nearest neighbor for every node.
Notice that the similarity between Dave and Eve is very low.
Setting the `similarityCutoff` parameter to 0.10 will filter the relationship between them, removing it from the result.

As we can see from the results, the number of created relationships is equal to the number of rows in the streaming example.

[NOTE]
====
The relationships that are produced by the mutation are always directed, even if the input graph is undirected.
If for example `a -> b` is topK for `a` and symmetrically `b -> a` is topK for `b`, it appears as though an undirected relationship is produced.
However, they are just two directed relationships that have been independently produced.
====


[[algorithms-knn-examples-write]]
=== Write

The `write` execution mode extends the `stats` mode with an important side effect: for each pair of nodes we create a relationship with the similarity score as a property to the Neo4j database.
The type of the new relationship is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeRelationshipType`.
Each new relationship stores the similarity score between the two nodes it represents.
The relationship property key is set using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeProperty`.
The result is a single summary row, similar to `stats`, but with some additional metrics.

For more details on the `write` mode in general, see <<running-algos-write>>.
