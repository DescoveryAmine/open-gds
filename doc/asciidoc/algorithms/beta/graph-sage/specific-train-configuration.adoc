| featureProperties                                                                | List of String  | n/a       | no       | The names of the node properties that should be used as input features. All property names must exist in the projected graph and be of type Float or List of Float.
| embeddingDimension                                                               | Integer       | 64        | yes      | The dimension of the generated node embeddings as well as their hidden layer representations.
| aggregator                                                                       | String        | "mean"    | yes      | The aggregator to be used by the layers. Supported values are "mean" and "pool".
| activationFunction                                                               | String        | "sigmoid" | yes      | The activation function to be used in the model architecture. Supported values are "sigmoid" and "relu".
| sampleSizes                                                                      | List of Integer | [25, 10]  | yes      | A list of Integer values, the size of the list determines the number of layers and the values determine how many nodes will be sampled by the layers.
| projectedFeatureDimension                                                        | Integer       | n/a       | yes      | The dimension of the projected `featureProperties`. This enables multi-label GraphSage, where each label can have a subset of the `featureProperties`.
| batchSize                                                                        | Integer       | 100       | yes      | The number of nodes per batch.
| <<common-configuration-tolerance,tolerance>>                                     | Float         | 1e-4      | yes      | Tolerance used for the early convergence of an epoch.
| learningRate                                                                     | Float         | 0.1       | yes      | The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
| epochs                                                                           | Integer       | 1         | yes      | Number of times to traverse the graph.
| <<common-configuration-max-iterations,maxIterations>>                            | Integer       | 10        | yes      | Maximum number of weight updates per batch. Batches can also converge early based on `tolerance`.
| searchDepth                                                                      | Integer       | 5         | yes      | Maximum depth of the RandomWalks to sample nearby nodes for the training.
| negativeSampleWeight                                                             | Integer       | 20        | yes      | The weight of the negative samples. Higher values increase the impact of negative samples in the loss.
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String        | null      | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| randomSeed                                                                       | Integer       | random    | yes      | A random seed which is used to control the randomness in computing the embeddings.
