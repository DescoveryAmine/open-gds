= Graph Generation

[abstract]
--
This section describes how random graphs can be generated in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

In certain use cases it is useful to generate random graphs, for example, for testing or benchmarking purposes.
For that reason the Neo4j Graph Algorithm library comes with a set of built-in graph generators.
The generator stores the resulting graph in the <<graph-catalog-ops, graph catalog>>.
That graph can be used as input for any algorithm in the library.

[NOTE]
====
It is currently not possible to persist these graphs in Neo4j.
Running an algorithm in write mode on a generated graph will lead to unexpected results.
====

The graph generation is parameterized by three dimensions:

 * node count - the number of nodes in the generated graph
 * average degree - describes the average out-degree of the generated nodes
 * relationship distribution function - the probability distribution method used to connect generated nodes

[[graph-generation-distribution]]
== Relationship Distribution

The `relationshipDistribution` parameter controls the statistical method used for the generation of new relationships.
Currently there are three supported methods:

* `UNIFORM` - Distributes the outgoing relationships evenly, i.e., every node has exactly the same out degree (equal to the average degree). The target nodes are selected randomly.
* `RANDOM` - Distributes the outgoing relationships using a normal distribution with an average of `averageDegree` and a standard deviation of `2 * averageDegree`. The target nodes are selected randomly.
* `POWER_LAW` - Distributes the incoming relationships using a power law distribution. The out degree is based on a normal distribution.


[[graph-generation-seed]]
== Relationship Seed

The `relationshipSeed` parameter allows, to generate graphs with the same relationships, if they have no property.
Currently the `relationshipProperty` is not seeded, therefore the generated graphs can differ in their property values.
Hence generated graphs based on the same `relationshipSeed` are not identical.

[[graph-generation-relationship-property]]
== Relationship Property

The graph generator is capable of generating a relationship property.
This can be controlled using the `relationshipProperty` parameter which accepts the following parameters:

|===
| Name    | Type      | Default | Optional  | Description
| name    | String    | null    | no        | The name under which the property values are stored.
| type    | String    | null    | no        | The method used to generate property values.
| min     | Float     | 0.0     | yes       | Minimal value of the generated property (only supported by `RANDOM`).
| max     | Float     | 1.0     | yes       | Maximum value of the generated property (only supported by `RANDOM`).
| value   | Float     | null    | yes       | Fixed value assigned to every relationship (only supported by `FIXED`).
|===

Currently, there are two supported methods to generate relationship properties:

* `FIXED` - Assigns a fixed value to every relationship. The `value` parameter must be set.
* `RANDOM` - Assigns a random value between the lower (`min`) and upper (`max`) bound.
