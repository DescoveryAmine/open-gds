[abstract]
--
This chapter provides explanations and examples for auxiliary procedures in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Auxiliary procedures are extra tools that can be useful in your workflow. +
The Neo4j GDS library includes the following auxiliary procedures, grouped by quality tier:

* Beta
** <<graph-generation, Graph Generation>>
* Alpha
** <<algorithms-collapse-path, Collapse Path>>
** <<algorithms-scale-properties, Scale Properties>>
** <<algorithms-one-hot-encoding-sample, One Hot Encoding>>
** <<algorithms-split-relationships, Split Relationships>>
