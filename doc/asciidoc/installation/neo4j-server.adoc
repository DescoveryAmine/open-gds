= Neo4j Server

The GDS library is intended to be used on a standalone Neo4j server.

[NOTE]
====
Running the GDS library in a Neo4j Causal Cluster is not supported.
Read more about how to use GDS in conjunction with Neo4j Causal Cluster deployment <<installation-causal-cluster, below>>.
====

On a standalone Neo4j Server, the library will need to be installed and configured manually.

1. Download `neo4j-graph-data-science-[version].jar` from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/#algorithms[Neo4j Download Center] and copy it into the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory.


2. Add the following to your `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----
This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.
+

3. Check if the procedure allowlist is enabled in the `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file and add the GDS library if necessary:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.allowlist=gds.*
----
+

NOTE: Before `Neo4j 4.2`, the configuration setting is called `dbms.security.procedures.whitelist`


4. Restart Neo4j

== Verifying installation

To verify your installation, the library version can be printed by entering into the browser in Neo4j Desktop and calling the `gds.version()` function:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
RETURN gds.version()
----

To list all installed algorithms, run the `gds.list()` procedure:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.list()
----
