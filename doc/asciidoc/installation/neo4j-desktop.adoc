The most convenient way of installing the GDS library is through the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/neo4j-desktop/index.html[Neo4j Desktop^] plugin called Neo4j Graph Data Science.
The plugin can be found in the 'Plugins' tab of a database.

The installer will download the GDS library and install it in the 'plugins' directory of the database.
It will also add the following entry to the settings file:

----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----

This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.

If the procedure allowlist is configured, make sure to also include procedures from the GDS library:

----
dbms.security.procedures.allowlist=gds.*
----

NOTE: Before `Neo4j 4.2`, the configuration setting is called `dbms.security.procedures.whitelist`
