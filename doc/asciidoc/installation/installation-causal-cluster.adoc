= Neo4j Causal Cluster

In a Neo4j Causal Cluster, GDS should only be installed on a _Read Replica_ instance.

In order to install the GDS library on a _Read Replica_ you can follow the steps from <<neo4j-server>>.
Additionally, the Neo4j Causal Cluster must be configured to use https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/internals/#clustering-routing[server-side routing].

[NOTE]
====
GDS on Clusters works on **Neo4j 4.3+**.
There is no intention to support earlier versions of the database.
