= Additional configuration options

In order to make use of certain features of the GDS library, additional configuration is necessary.
Configuration is done in the _neo4j.conf_ configuration file before starting the DBMS.
The following features require such additional configuration:


== Graph export

Exporting <<catalog-graph-export-csv, graphs to CSV>> files requires the configuration parameter `gds.export.location` to be set to the absolut path to the folder in which exported graphs will be stored.
This directory has to be writable by the Neo4j process.


== Model persistence

The <<model-catalog-store-ops, model persistence feature>> requires the configuration parameter `gds.model.store_location` to be set to the absolut path to the folder in which the models will be stored.
This directory has to be writable by the Neo4j process.
