This chapter provides a brief introduction of the main concepts in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

This library provides efficiently implemented, parallel versions of common graph algorithms for Neo4j, exposed as Cypher procedures.


[[introduction-algorithms]]
== Algorithms

Graph algorithms are used to compute metrics for graphs, nodes, or relationships.

They can provide insights on relevant entities in the graph (centralities, ranking), or inherent structures like communities (community-detection, graph-partitioning, clustering).

Many graph algorithms are iterative approaches that frequently traverse the graph for the computation using random walks, breadth-first or depth-first searches, or pattern matching.

Due to the exponential growth of possible paths with increasing distance, many of the approaches also have high algorithmic complexity.

Fortunately, optimized algorithms exist that utilize certain structures of the graph, memoize already explored parts, and parallelize operations.
Whenever possible, we've applied these optimizations.

The Neo4j Graph Data Science library contains a large number of algorithms, which are detailed in the <<algorithms, Algorithms>> chapter.


[[introduction-algorithms-traits]]
=== Algorithm traits

Algorithms in GDS have specific ways to make use of various aspects of its input graph(s).
We call these _algorithm traits_.
When an algorithm supports an algorithm trait this indicates that the algorithm has been implemented to produce well-defined results in accordance with the trait.
The following algorithm traits exist:

[[introduction-algorithms-directed]]
Directed::
The algorithm is well-defined on a directed graph.

[[introduction-algorithms-undirected]]
Undirected::
The algorithm is well-defined on an undirected graph.

[[introduction-algorithms-homogeneous]]
Homogeneous::
The algorithm will treat all nodes and relationships in its input graph(s) similarly, as if they were all of the same type.
If multiple types of nodes or relationships exist in the graph, this must be taken into account when analysing the results of the algorithm.

[[introduction-algorithms-heterogeneous]]
Heterogeneous::
The algorithm has the ability to distinguish between nodes and/or relationships of different types.

[[introduction-algorithms-weighted]]
Weighted::
The algorithm supports configuration to set node and/or relationship properties to use as weights.
These values can represent _cost_, _time_, _capacity_ or some other domain-specific properties, specified via the <<common-configuration-node-weight-property, nodeWeightProperty>>, nodeProperties and <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property, relationshipWeightProperty>> configuration parameters.
The algorithm will by default consider each node and/or relationship as equally important.


[[introduction-catalog]]
== Graph Catalog

In order to run the algorithms as efficiently as possible, the Neo4j Graph Data Science library uses a specialized graph format to represent the graph data.
It is therefore necessary to load the graph data from the Neo4j database into an in memory graph catalog.
The amount of data loaded can be controlled by so called graph projections, which also allow, for example, filtering on node labels and relationship types, among other options.
