This section details the pipeline catalog operations available to manage named training pipelines within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

In GDS, we have machine learning pipelines which offer an end-to-end workflow, from graph feature extraction to model training.
One such example is the <<algorithms-ml-linkprediction-pipelines, link prediction pipeline>>.

The pipeline catalog is a concept within the GDS library that allows managing multiple training pipelines by name.


This chapter explains the available pipeline catalog operations.
