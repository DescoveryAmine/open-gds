# GDS Docs README

## Setup

We use asciidoc for writing documentation, and we render it to both HTML and PDF.

### A note on inline LaTeX: you can't

Currently, our toolchain cannot render LaTeX snippets into PDF (works for HTML tho!). So we are unable to use it.

What you can do though is use _cursive_, `monospace` and `.svg` images for anything more complicated. https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php is helpful for inputting LaTeX and outputting `.svg` images, or any other image format for that matter. We seem to use `.svg` so maybe stick to that.
